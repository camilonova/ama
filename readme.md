# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

I'm a full stack software developer, I do contribute as much as I can to open source usually in Python.
I was the founder of [Django Bogota](http://www.meetup.com/Django-Bogota/) and I'm a [Django Developer Member](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/developer-members/).
